In this project, we plan to develop and implement a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm and compete with other methods on OpenAI Gym. Specifically, we will implement DQN and use it as baseline. Based on its performance, we will conduct a series of analysis and try to improve the baseline.
%
DQN adopts a neural network parametrized by $\theta$. The goal is to obtain an optimal estimate of the Q-function by training a model:
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \arg\max_\theta Q(s,a;\theta)
\end{equation*}
where $s$ stands for a state and $a$ denotes the corresponding action. 
The evaluation will be performed on the OpenAI Gym.
