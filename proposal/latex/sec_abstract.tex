Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved
unprecedented success in many challenging
domains~\cite{mnih2015human,silver2016mastering}, by combining the power of modeling complex
functions of deep learning and the fairly general-purpose framework of reinforcement learning.
In this project, we proposed a new methods in DRL for the purpose of playing Atari games and 
the experiments will be conducted on OpenAI Gym. \highlight{to be modified.}
