Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved
unprecedented success in many challenging
domains~\cite{mnih2015human,silver2016mastering}, by combining the power of modeling complex
functions of deep learning and the fairly general-purpose framework of reinforcement learning.
In this project, we \textbf{propose} a new methods that firstly distill the knowledge to a dueling Q-network,
by which the training procedure can be speed up.
Also, we \textbf{implemented} another state-of-arts method--A3C algorithm~\cite{mnih2016asynchronous} to 
as one of our baselines.
The extensive experiments have been conducted on OpenAI Gym~\cite{brockman2016openai} to evaluate 
our proposed method and implementations.
