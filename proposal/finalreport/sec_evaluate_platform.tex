In order to evaluate the algorithm, we conduct our experiments on Atari environment
provided by OpenAI. OpenAI Gym~\cite{brockman2016openai} is a toolkit for reinforcement learning
research. It includes a growing collection of benchmark problems that expose a
common interface, and a website where people can share their results and
compare the performance of algorithms.
% Take one of the Atary games--Pong as an example:
% \begin{quote}
% Maximize your score in the Atari 2600 game. In this
% environment, the observation is an RGB image of the screen, which is an array
% of shape (210, 160, 3) Each action is repeatedly performed for a duration of
% kk frames, where kk is uniformly sampled from \{2, 3, 4\}~\cite{brockman2016openai}
% \end{quote}
For more information please refer to the \href{https://gym.openai.com/}{OpenAI gym website}.
% All games are unsolved environments, which means those games don't have a specific reward 
% that you can consider it as the end of the game.
